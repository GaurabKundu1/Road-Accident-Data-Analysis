An interactive Dashboard created by [Gaurab Kundu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurab-kundu/)

## Project Description

A major issue that has an impact on communities all across the world is road safety. In this project I have created a Road Accident Analytics Dashboard, a powerful tool designed to analyse and visualize road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. This Excel-based dashboard empowers stakeholders with valuable insights to make data-driven decisions and pave the way towards safer roads.

## Skills showcased in this Project

- Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Analysis
- Filtering, Sorting and Conditional function.
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Chart
- Data Visulisation and Dashboard creation

## Requirements and KPIs

Clients want to create a road accident dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on following aspects-

- Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth
- Primary KPI's-Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth
- Secondary KPIs - Total Casualties concerning vehicle type for the Current Year
- Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year
- Casualties by Road Type for the Current Year
- Current Year Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/Night
- Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location

## Data used

The dataset can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V-u_v6Ntd_F_Haqw2f1ZjNT54HNmu7Rn/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113907451729758661404&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.

1. Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors
2. Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3. Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
4. Creating 2 new attributes 'Year' and 'Month' were added for logical and easy interpretation of dataset.

## Data Analysis

Created a "Data Analysis" sheet to summarize all the pivot table Data for a new user or developer or client to ease their work and gathered information. On this sheet nine pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between number of casualties and many factors such as- casualty type, vehicle type, road type, location etc. Monthly trends were also analysed for the years 2021 and 2022.

Below is a snippet of the Data Analysis Sheet:

## Data Visualization

Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and customizing the pivot charts of corresponding pivot table. For user friendly and interactive experience slicers and timelines were incorporated. Hyperlinks and connections were also added to necessary icons for seamless navigation.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel:
