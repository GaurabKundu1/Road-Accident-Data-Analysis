## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.

1. Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors
2. Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3. Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
4. Creating 2 new attributes 'Year' and 'Month' were added for logical and easy interpretation of dataset.
